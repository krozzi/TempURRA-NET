# TempURRA-NET
Official codebase for TempURRA-NET.
The actual dataset for which this model is being trained on has been left out for the sake of uploading the files in a timely manner. 
However, the dataset is always readily available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/manideep1108/tusimple/activity) and is around ~21GB.

## A quick heads up
While my project did put heavy emphasis on reproducability and sustainability in papers and models, the current state of this codebase is still very messy and is being rewritten from the ground up in order to change how data is handeled and parameters configured in order to make it future-compatable with Lane.EV. Thank you for understanding.
